1)Experimental design:
Intron Retention: Embrio, Adult Stem Cells, Entero, Paneth. From these 4 samples we mapped the intron retained and in the "Intron Retention Bed Files" you have the files.
Chromatin: H3K27Ac and H3K4me3 in Embrio, Adult Stem Cells, Entero, Paneth. From these 4 samples we have significant peaks in the "Chromatin" folder. 


2)Sum up of the folders:
Intron retention bed files" for each cell type there are the intron that retained at a level that is significant. There is also a folder "Intron retention annotated" with the coordinate of all the introns that are annotated in the mm10 mouse model (this is your "all space"). 

In Chromatin folder:
K4me3_peaks folder= file K4me3_called_peaks.xlsx has the significan peaks that belong to enterocites rep1 and enterocites rep2, e125 rep1 e125 rep2, e145 rep1 e145 rep2 (these 2 you do not need!! because we have intron retantion data only from e125), Intestinal Stem Cells rep1, Intestianl Stem Cells rep2. In file H3K4me3_Paneth.xlsx you have significant events of Paneth cells rep1 and Paneth cells rep2.

K27ac_peaks = file adultk27ac.xlsx you have peaks of Instestinal Stem Cells Rep1 and Intestinal Stem Cells rep2. In embryonicK27ac.xlsx you have peaks for embryo rep1 and embrio rep2. In K27Ac_Paneth.xls you have Paneth Rep1 and Paneth Rep2. 


3) Remember:
the coordinate of the Chromatin Marks have to be converted with liftover from mm9 to mm10 as the intron retantion are in mm10. Then if there is something interesting that
we have to visualize we re-run the chip-seq data with the mm10 annotation. 


4) Already did but to be re-done:
I just did intron retention in chromatin marks for H3K27ac and only embrio shows overlap and a significant value with the chisquare test. Do it again and then we can compare
the results. I did not do anything with H3K4me3
